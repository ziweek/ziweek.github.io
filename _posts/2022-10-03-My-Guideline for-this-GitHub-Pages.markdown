This is a guideline to manage my GitHub Pages. The posts can be anything that I studied or I am interested in. They are mainly about Business Administration, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and BlockChain Tech. And also sometimes posts can be written in several languages such as Korean, Japanese and maybe another languages. It is just aimed for the improvement of my language skills.

So then, in those sense, I hope that I would never give up my own challenge which means "one day, one post".


And there is another reason why I am trying to do these things. It is because  I want to check my status and measure each level of growth. In that process, I can understand myself much better and I can try to focus on my weakness. For this reason, I will annually come back to this `__init__` post and I will stack annual records of my improvements.


So, this is my first post which is written in English. I wish that it could be a good start. 


## What I can do in 2022

Data Science
